# Project 5: Post PR To Do List

## 1. Fix the proof in section 4
* analyze the relations between the approximation ratio and the width of the strip
* analyze the relations between the approximation ratio and the different distributions of widths and heights

## 2. NP-C or NP-H? (Section 1)
* Put down a sentence or two explaining why

## 3. Re-word algorithm specification (???)
* Section 2 of nfdhPack()?

## 4. Draw out the rest of the test cases
* @ the group who said....

     *better designed or confrontational cases can be implemented*

## 5. Fix source code in appendix.
* Use screenshots instead of direct copy & pasting... (Is this allowed??)

## 7. Slightly change output specifications
* "Time taken" output, fix readme in code folder

## 8. I don't think we need anymore test cases.
