# Input/Output Specification



## Input Specification

The program first receives, in one line, two positive integers **W** and **N**, where **W** is the width of the texture atlas that the images will be packed into and **N** is the number of images to be packed.

The program then receives *N* lines of input. Each line specifies an images and contains two positive integers **h** and **w**, the pixel height and width of the image, respectively.

## Output Specification

The program outputs **N** lines, specifying the positions of the images in the texture atlas. Each line contains two non-negative integers **x** and **y**, the x and y position of the bottom left pixel of the image in the texture atlas, respectively. The positions are output in the same order as the input sizes are input; that is, the i-th position in output corresponds to the i-th image in input.

If the input width **w** of one or more of the images is less than 1, or greater than the texture atlas width **W**, "Invalid Input" is output and the program terminates.
